# What is demography?

### Demographers study population processes and how populations change over time. 


- Interested structural and spatial changes, and how these population-level changes are intertwined with societal, economic, health, and welfare changes. 


- A large part of demography includes developing good estimates of the main drivers of population change: fertility, mortality, and migration. 



---

# Why am I talking about it?

#### Demography is foundational to and has large overlap with many other fields, especially sociology, economics, and epidemiology.

(Also ecology)

# Reproducibility considerations

### Reproducibililty of demographic estimates should be of primary concern


- Used in public and health policy (e.g. things like mortality rates, but also population counts)


- Used in other fields of study (control for age, race/ethnicity)


#### Attitude is often 'taken as given' even though that isn't the case

--

- We built this city (field) on theoretical and empirical approximations

- Reproducibility is important to understand propagation of error and how demographic regularities may change over time

# Case study: average age of infant death


---
# Background

#### Life table quantity $_na_x$: "Average time lived for those who died"

- e.g. $_5a_{60}$: for those who died between ages 60-65, how long did they live past 60?

--

- A particular quantity of interest is the average age of infant death, i.e. the average number of days lived of those who died in the first year of life: $_1a_0$

--

- To get accurate measure, need individual life lines (know everyone's date of birth and death)

--

- More realistically, we usually only have death and population counts aggregated by age, so need to approximate

--

- It turns out there's a relatively strong relationship between $_1a_0$ and the infant mortality rate (number of infant deaths divided by live births)


---
# $_1a_0$ versus infant mortality

```

# Oh no

# Timeline

- Keyfitz-Flieger (1968, 1970, 1971): Tabulating World Populations
$$
_1a_0 = 0.07 + 1.7{_1M_0}
$$

--

- Lots of people citing KF through the 1990s and 2000s (including key textbooks)


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/poston.png", dpi = 300)
```

--

- Andreev and Kingkade (2015): updating using newly available data

--

- Alexander and Root (forthcoming): new method and data


#### Question: how reproducible is Keyfitz & Flieger, and Andreev & Kingkade?

---
# Keyfitz and Flieger (1971)

The empirical regression for $_1a_0$ is stated with no information about data or calculations.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/kf.jpeg", dpi = 200)
```


---
# Keyfitz and Flieger (1971)

Published life tables and other population statistics for countries all over the world

--
- Detailed exposition of methods, listed all data sources used, FORTRAN code


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/data.png", dpi = 500)
```

- In theory, could go through listed data sources, hope that they are still attainable, see which ones have required information, and do the regression.

# Reproducing Andreev and Kingkade (2015)

Updating equations based on new data

- Using publicly available data through Human Mortality Database and US linked birth-death files

--
- No data of code files available with paper, but a detailed description of the data

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/AK1.png", dpi = 200)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/AK2.png", dpi = 200)
```

# Reproducing Andreev and Kingkade (2015)

- Methods were also adequately described

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/AK3.png", dpi = 200)
```
.right[Andreev and Kingkade, 2015 (excerpt from pg 375)]

--
- Using a different fitting method (Bayesian cutpoint regression in Stan) but (close to) the same dataset, we were able to get similar results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/AR.png", dpi = 300)
```

```



---
# Our work 

- Prematurity as a cause of death
- Overall mortality conditions and prematurity forces act in opposing ways, which could explain the linear relationship breaking down at lower mortality levels

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

# Our work (reproducibility)

# Reproducibility in demography more generally


---
# What do we do well?

--

- A lot of datasets are public

    + [Human Mortality Database](https://mortality.org/), Human Fertility Database...
    + IPUMS


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/hmd.png", dpi = 400)
```
    
--

- (Usually) a careful tabulation of sources, assumptions and adjustments

    + e.g. [HMD Methods Protocol](https://mortality.org/Public/Docs/MP-Summary.pdf)

---
# What do we do well?


--

- Some of the top journals in the field are open access (*Demography*, *Demographic Research*)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/demog_repro.png", dpi = 500)
```
   

--

- Relatively(?) enthusiastic uptake of preprints and reproducibility

    + Posting to *Socarxiv* becoming the norm
    + *Demographic Research* has special series of replicable articles

---
# What can we improve?

--

- Distinguishing data versus estimates

    + e.g. UN World Population Prospects, Our World in Data

--

- Linking theory and implementation

    + still a gap in teaching demographic theory and how to implement using reproducible computing methods
    
--

- Qualitative / quantitative coding and reproducibility gap 

    + See my [TWR talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvM2C6aZ94k) from last year ðŸ˜Š

# Summary and takeaways

--

- Different levels of reproducibility

--

- Data, code, but also explanations

--

- Careful exposition increases confidence, but I am most confident when I can get the numbers myself (this includes in my own work ðŸ˜…)

--

- Modern tools make it so much easier, but it's easy to become complacent
