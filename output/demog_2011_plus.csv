Robert D. Mare; A Multigenerational View of Inequality. Demography 1 February 2011; 48 (1): 1–23. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0014-7,2011,"Multigenerational, Social mobility, Lineages, Inequality","In this light, it is easy to understand the history of sociological and economic research on the intergenerational correlation of various socioeconomic statuses. Starting in the 1960s, sociologists showed that correlations between the educational attainments or the occupational attainments of fathers and sons (using various scales and measures) ranged from about .35 to .40 (e.g., Blau and Duncan 1967). Yet the intergenerational correlations of incomes, measured using the data available at that time, were much lower, around .15 (e.g., Bielby and Hauser 1977). Stocks of human capital, indexed by educational attainment, and occupational entitlements are relatively durable and can last most of an adult life. By contrast, income flows, unless exceptionally large, are comparatively highly perishable. However, in the early 1990s, Solon (1992) and Zimmerman (1992), exploiting longitudinal income data in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), showed that averages of sequences of parent and of offspring incomes yield much higher correlations on the order of .4, about the same as the educational and occupational correlations discovered 30 years before. Since then, numerous econometric studies, using longer sequences of parent and offspring incomes in the PSID, as well as more reliable administrative income data, have pushed estimates of the intergenerational correlations of incomes ever higher. For example, a widely cited study by Mazumder (2005), using Social Security earnings data, puts the estimate at around .6. Similar results show up for other countries. The longer and more reliable the income sequences we use in such correlational studies, the closer we may approximate the intergenerational correlation of wealth. Studies of wealth transmission per se are rarer because of data and conceptual problems. It is beyond this essay to review these difficulties, but suffice it to say that wealth presents hard issues about ownership, fungibility, units of analysis, convertibility, and liquidity that go beyond our difficulties in thinking about and measuring incomes, occupations, or human capital. These problems notwithstanding, wealth tends to be more unequally distributed and more highly correlated across generations than the other three dimensions of inequality that have been studied so extensively.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,48

Most trajectory 1 and trajectory 2 countries have gone through to the fourth stage of the epidemiological transition; afterward, increases in the age of zero vitality respond slowly to the changes in ecological system. This notion can explain the lack of a nonzero regression relationship between D and B in Fig. 7 for the trajectory 1 and 2 countries. By contrast, trajectory 3 countries are more likely to be in the second or third stage of the epidemiological transition, wherein big increases in the age of zero vitality have been substantially influenced by imported modern medical technology made available through bilateral or international cooperation (Omran 1982) while their national ecological system improves slowly. This may explain the negative relationship between D and B in the trajectory 3 countries.

In contrast, the diamonds in Fig. 4 show that sex ratios of births reported in the 1980s were 2 or 3 per 100 above estimates based on children counted at older ages after 1990. In 1989, for instance, although the oft-quoted point estimate from the 1990 census was 111.3, demographic evidence since then consistently suggests that the true ratio was 3 per 100 below that, or about 108.3. Johansson and Nygren (1991) and Zeng et al. (1993) reached a similar conclusion based on other methods and data available at the time. If the normal ratio is 106,12 excess underreporting of daughters accounted for 57% of the reported female birth shortage in 1989 [1–(108.3–106.0)/111.3–106.0)]. Underreporting by sex also varied greatly among China’s provinces,13 so overt sex discrimination cannot fully account for regional variation in reported sex ratios, as one would infer from recent studies that either downplay excess daughter underreporting (Das Gupta, Chung, and Li 2009; Zhu et al. 2009) or do not consider it (Attane 2009; Ebenstein 2010).",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,48

A social tie to a current or former migrant constitutes a potential source of social capital because someone with migratory experience can provide information, resources, and assistance to lower the costs of movement of a potential migrant (Massey et al. 1998). In our analysis, we measure social capital by introducing three dummy variables to indicate whether the respondent had at least one member in his or her household who had, in 1996, migrated within Chitwan, to other districts in Nepal, or to other countries. Irrespective of the level of violence, we expect to observe strong destination-specific effects of social capital on migration, with ties to international migrants predicting international migration, ties to internal migrants predicting internal migration, and ties to local migrants predicting migration within Chitwan.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,49

Information on the duration of stay in the current place of residence (urban or rural) and on the previous place of residence of the mother is available through two questions asked in the women’s questionnaire: “How long have you been living continuously in (name of locality, town or city of current residence)?” and “Just before you moved here, did you live in a city, in a town, or in the countryside?” We use this information to estimate infant and child mortality rates that are adjusted for migration status. The age at death is computed in months, and censoring time is also computed in months. The month and year of birth for children are available for 85% of children. The lowest percentages with complete details on date of birth are found in Benin (52%), Togo (67%), Mozambique (71%), and Senegal (75%), and the percentage varies between 84% and 98% in the other 14 countries. In the DHS, the age at death is supposed to be recorded in months before the age of 1, and in years thereafter. In some countries, age at death is recorded in months before the age of 2.

However, it is unlikely that the expansion of AIDS-targeted foreign aid explains a large part of what we see in our data. Grépin’s numbers indicated that foreign aid for AIDS grew little until the year 2000 and then escalated rapidly as funds for ART became available through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other programs. This pattern is consistent with increases in access to ART. The number of people in sub-Saharan Africa receiving ART is estimated to have been only 100,000 in 2003, but then rose to 1.375 million in 2006 and to 2.12 million in 2007 (World Health Organization 2008). Our results indicate that the divergence in antenatal care and immunizations between high- and low-AIDS regions began in the early- to mid-1990s, before foreign aid for AIDS was significant and when very few Africans were receiving ART.

Violent crime includes homicides, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults. Property crime includes burglaries, larcenies, and motor vehicle thefts. Because information about the local crime rate is unavailable at the block-group level, we use the crime rate for respondents’ census tract in this analysis.

Individual-level data with HIV status are not publicly available for South Africa, preventing a direct examination of this hypothesis. However, in all the high-prevalence countries with publicly available DHS data including serostatus, suggestive evidence exists that it is indeed the process of becoming married that garners risk. If becoming married carries much risk, then we should observe surviving couples being more likely to test jointly negative if they have been married for long enough that preexisting infections should have resulted in death. In Online Resource 1, I show that monogamous couples who have been married for at least 10 years are substantially (and statistically significantly in every DHS country available, save Lesotho) more likely to test jointly negative than couples who have been married 0–5 years. This trend is robust to flexible age and spousal age controls and in some cases, represents truly substantial risk reductions.

Also not known publicly is whether the ultimate rates of decline in adult cancer vacillate because of a substantive belief held by the SSA or instead because of necessary adjustment to achieve a smooth age profile. We observe a similarly curious vacillation in vascular disease mortality ultimate rates of decline. The ultimate rate of decline for male vascular disease mortality is posited to be 1.8% between ages 15 and 49, down to 1.5% between ages 50 and 64, up to 2.5% between ages 65 and 84, and back down to 1.9% for ages 85 and older.

Ideally, migration reports should reflect a single timing criterion: for example, the 12-month long-term criterion recommended by the United Nations (1998).

The compiled data are publicly available online (www.schoolinfo.go.kr). We use data of the total number of senior students and the numbers of those seniors who were enrolled in four-year colleges and in two-year junior colleges, separately, one year after high school graduation as well as other school-level variables, such as the number of teachers (female and male) and the number of students receiving lunch support (provided to students from low-income families). For coeducational schools, the data provide the number of high school seniors and college attendants by gender. Whereas our data for college entrance exam scores cover only one cohort, our data for college entrance rates cover two separate cohorts per school: the 2008 senior cohort and the 2009 senior cohort.5 However, because this data set does not include any measures for teacher quality, using school names as identifiers, we further attach to this data set two teacher-quality measures (average years of teaching experience and schooling attainment of teachers in each school) available from school data gathered for the Statistical Yearbook of Education by the Korean Educational Development Institute (http://cesi.kedi.re.kr). These two additional measures are useful to compare school quality between single-sex and coeducational schools. After deleting some specialized schools for which the high school equalization policy is not applied, the final sample consists of 196 high schools across 11 school districts per year (i.e., a total of 392 observations; no school changed its single-sex or coeducational status).6 Among these 196 high schools, 68 are all-boys, 60 are all-girls, and 68 are coeducational.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,57

Such forecasts would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950–1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 % less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 % prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 % of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country).

However, after the age-/race-/sex-specific standard schedules at the national level are prepared (and updated when new data become available),8 they can be employed as model standard schedules for projections at the subnational level. This is similar to the widely practiced application of model life tables (e.g., Coale et al. 1983; United Nations 1982), the Brass logit relational life table model (e.g., Murray et al. 2003), the Brass relational Gompertz fertility model (Brass 1974), and other parameterized models (e.g., Coale and Trussell 1974; Rogers 1986) in population projections and estimations. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the relational parameterized models consisting of a model standard schedule and a few summary parameters offer an efficient and realistic way to project or estimate demographic age-specific rates (Booth 1984; Brass 1978; Paget and Timaeus 1994; Zeng et al. 1994). The theoretical foundation of applications of the model life tables and the other model standard schedules is that the demographic summary parameters are crucial for determining changes in level and age pattern of the age-specific rates that affect the projections or estimations. At the same time, the projection and estimation results themselves are typically not highly sensitive to the race-/sex-/age-specific model standard schedules as long as the possible changes in the general shape of the standard schedules and timing of the demographic events are properly modeled by the relevant summary parameters (e.g., mean or median age, interquartile range). Two tests in our previous publications (Zeng et al. 2000, 2006) have corroborated the empirical applicability of Core Idea 4 of the ProFamy model, which employs national model standard schedules and summary parameters at the subnational level to specify projected demographic rates of the subnational regions in future years.

The analysis for this study focused on the third generation of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (Splansky et al. 2007). The original cohort of the FHS was first assessed in 1948; nearly 25 years later, the respondents’ children (the G2 sample, n = 3,548) and many of their spouses participated in the offspring cohort study. Then, in 2002, roughly 4,000 adults who had at least one parent in the offspring cohort took part in the third generation (G3) cohort study. This cohort was examined for a variety of different morbidities using clinical and laboratory assessments. Crucially, study participants were measured for height and weight. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the FHS G3 sample that we use in our analysis by educational status. Those without a college degree have an average BMI that is 1.44 units higher than those with a college degree (p < .001).

Child fostering is the situation in which children with living parents are sent to live in a different household, most often with other relatives. These arrangements are informally negotiated between family members and are usually temporary. Fostering has long been recognized by demographers as a risk-coping mechanism used by households to offset economic or demographic hardships, to take advantage of resources available through extended kin networks, and to redistribute the costs and benefits of childbearing across the extended family (Akresh 2009; Isiugo-Abanihe 1985; Lloyd and Desai 1992; Madhavan 2004; Mason 1997; McDaniel and Zulu 1996; Notermans 2004).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

The IRDC is a collaboration of IPUMS with many statistical agencies, and the details of the configuration are still being negotiated.

Unfortunately, most available data sets on adult mortality do not permit constituting reasonably complete lists of the maternal siblings of a SSH respondent. VR and census data, for example, are rarely available at the individual level because of confidentiality issues. When available, VR data include only the name of the mother on the birth certificate, which is not sufficient to establish a sibship list: a fairly large number of individuals who are not siblings may have a mother with the same name. Census/survey data on recent household deaths do not collect information on the biological mother of recently deceased household members. They thus permit identifying siblings only if they reside in the same household as their live mother at the time of the census/survey. Even then, reports of household relationships may be affected by “adoption bias”: that is, the caretaker of a household member may be mistakenly classified as his/her “mother” by the household informant.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

A key set of these consequences is health-related. Rural-to-urban migration can influence migrants’ health and well-being through its effects on affluence, exposure to new environmental risks and benefits, by stimulating changes in cultural expectations and patterns of behavior, and by providing access to resources that were unavailable at the place of origin. These migration-related processes can impact migrants’ well-being positively and negatively. A substantial body of literature assesses health outcomes among immigrants to the developed world, but less attention has been paid to the health impacts of internal migration. Although both types of migration entail leaving a familiar environment for an unfamiliar one, international migrants typically face more formidable language and cultural challenges than do migrants who stay within their country’s borders. Nevertheless, the adaptations required by migrants moving from a rural setting to an urban one can be profound, especially when they are undertaken outside the context of one’s usual social network. With rapid urbanization underway in many developing countries, internal migration—especially rural-to-urban movement—is occurring on an even larger scale than international migration (International Organization for Migration 2005; King et al. 2008).1",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Network ties are a form of social capital that provides potential migrants with access to resources in their sending and receiving countries, but not all forms of social capital have equal value for migration (Fussell 2004, 2010; Fussell and Massey 2004). Male and female migrants access social capital differently, and gender shapes the kinds of resources available through network contacts (Cerrutti and Gaudio 2010; Curran et al. 2005; Grasmuck and Pessar 1991; Kanaiaupuni 2000). Prevailing gendered institutions in sending countries influence men and women’s access to social capital and, subsequently, their odds of migrating to the United States.

Some migrants actively move back and forth between host and sending countries, while some spend extended periods in the host country. The frequency of migration trips and length of time spent in the United States represent different kinds of migration experience that influence the resources available through network ties. Frequent trips between sending and host countries allow migrants to maintain ties in their communities of origin that facilitate future migration of other community members, even when migrants settle permanently in the host country (Winters et al. 2001). As a result, strong ties to previous migrants that make numerous trips between countries should increase the odds of migration (Davis et al. 2002; Massey and Zenteno 1999; Winters et al. 2001).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Although this study examines early gentrification, the rapid and widespread gentrification and immigrant settlement patterns of today are often dependent on preexisting neighborhood formations (Hackworth and Smith 2001; Waldinger 1989). The increased demand for affordable housing, the growth of multiethnic neighborhoods, and changing race-based residential preferences impact residential selection processes and have important implications for the future of residential segregation and immigrant incorporation. Data distinguishing nativity by racial and ethnic group became publicly available after 2000, and these differences should be examined in studies of more recent neighborhood changes. Moreover, an updated understanding of residential selection processes and discriminatory behaviors, more generally, that considers the intersection of nativity with race and ethnicity would enhance this area of research.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

The ACS is conducted annually, with continuous sampling throughout the year, and its publicly available, individual-level data are based on 1 % of the U.S. population. (See Table 1.) Therefore, five years of ACS data are required to approximate the CLF sample size. The ACS migration question compares current residence with that one year ago, thus capturing migration over a one-year period. Because of the smaller sample size and shorter migration window, in most analyses, we use 2006–2010 ACS data (capturing 2005–2010 migration) to create a comparable counterpart and what we dub a 2010 update to the earlier CLF samples.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA

Because the long-form was collected simultaneously with the short form, 100 % population counts are available to adjust the sample data at a very low level of geography: contiguous block groups with as few as 400 sample persons (Schindler 2005; U.S. Census Bureau 2002). However, the ACS uses population controls from the Population Estimates Program (PEP), resulting in lower-quality estimates. Although PEP uses the decennial census counts as a baseline, it must rely on other sources of data, such as birth and death records, in an attempt to bring estimates up to date. Consequently, PEP estimates are much less accurate than a full census. They are also not available at finer units of analysis: estimates are produced for counties or groups of small-population counties and for subcounty areas, such as minor civil divisions (MCDs) and incorporated places. As a result, adjustments are made using a two-step process with these much larger units (see U.S. Census Bureau 2009a,b).2 Although the process increases the reliability of ACS population estimates (Starsinic 2005), the result is a less-refined product than comparable long-form data.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA

Information on student achievement comes from a variety of sources. Baseline math achievement test scores were available through the district administrative records and were measured for all students as students’ most recent prior scores on end-of-year state assessment exams.11 The state endline assessments were missing for the majority of the high school students. Federal law requires states to assess students only once in high schools, and there is no uniformity across the states on the timing (grade level) of assessment. Therefore, MPR administered a computer adaptive end-of-year math assessment exam at the high school level. The assessments were exclusively for the course taken and were developed by the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA). Unfortunately, the data set does not contain any information on endline reading achievement, and thus the achievement outcome of interest throughout this article is the endline math test scores. Scores were standardized with respect to either the state or the national reference population. Specifically, the reference population for state assessment (baseline) math test scores was the entire set of students who took the same assessment in the same state, year, and grade; and for the endline math test scores, it was the nationwide NWEA normative sample.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA

For instance, Wilmoth and Koso (2002) made the strong assumption of equal sharing of wealth in the household by assigning one-half of the household wealth to each partner, finding a larger marriage premium for women than for men compared with the never married. Schmidt and Sevak (2006) and Yamokoski and Keister (2006) found larger household-level marriage wealth premiums for women than for men compared with the never married, ignoring the within-household distribution of wealth. Ruel and Hauser (2013) found married women who are their households’ best financial survey respondents to have less household wealth than their male counterparts, but the marriage premium compared with the never married seems slightly larger for women than for men. The study conflated selectivity in being a household’s best respondent and gender, and ignored the within-household distribution of wealth. Finally, a few studies have examined pension wealth, the only wealth component for which data are often available at the individual level. These studies mostly found marriage penalties in pension wealth for women (e.g. Fasang et al. 2013).

The data provide extensive details on household relationship, age, name(s) and name changes, occupation, marriage, emigration, geographic location, and SES as well as information on fertility and mortality. Importantly, the CMGPD-LN also includes a constructed outcome variable specifying whether an individual died in the next three years. This is specifically intended for use as a dependent variable in a discrete-time event-history analysis of mortality.

That is, all trends in educational attainment assessed here occur over the span of the relatively brief time interval of just two decades. I will return to a discussion of potential longer-term trends in the Conclusion section. To track cohort changes in educational attainment, I compare children born in the 1970s with children born in the 1980s and assess whether, at age 20 (N = 2,334 and N = 2,691, respectively), they had graduated from high school and had gained any college experience, as well as whether, by age 25 (N = 1,799 and N = 2,545), they had completed a bachelor’s degree.3 The indicators of educational attainment available here record only whether a year of college has been completed and therefore do not allow the separate identification of students who enter college but drop out within the first year, nor do they allow distinguishing between different types of colleges attended.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Home value indicators are more easily collected than full-fledged asset survey modules and are often readily accessible through administrative or linked external data. For instance, drawing on home values to approximate wealth gaps in education may allow historical assessments of wealth inequality in education (e.g., based on the housing values reported on the publicly available 1940 U.S. Census), longer-term assessments of additional cohorts (e.g., based on the housing information consistently observed in the PSID since 1968), or detailed analyses of wealth gaps in college pathways based on administrative data held by colleges and states that also include the addresses of students’ pre-college residence (for which external real estate data yield estimates of home values).",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

As shown in Table 1, panel A, a child born to parents at the 25th percentile, on average, reaches the 42nd percentile at age 30; a child born in the bottom quintile has, on average, 8.34 % chance of reaching the top quintile across the CZs in the main sample. Third, I examine spatial differences in relative mobility, which is captured by the slope in a regression of children’s income rank on parents’ income rank in each CZ, similar in spirit to conventional intergenerational elasticity (IGE) of income estimates for which higher values correspond to less mobility (Dahl and DeLeire 2008).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Previous research has shown that calculating state-level averages based on GSS data produces relatively good indications of state-level attitudes (Brace et al. 2002). State identifiers were not included in (the publicly available) version of the GSS data. Given that census divisions aggregate states into larger categories, we are less concerned about the regional representativeness of the GSS data. However, this is less clear for our division of each region into metro/nonmetro areas. We therefore follow Brace et al.’s (2002) procedure to investigate the representativeness of the GSS to these 18 areas. We correlate the share of college-educated and black persons in each area and year based on the GSS with the corresponding numbers calculated using the ACS. Correlations are high (.63 and .83; Brace et al. reported .77 and .93 for education and race/ethnicity respectively; after using only region, we find correlations of .80 and .94), thus reducing concerns that the GSS is not representative for the areas used in this article.

Data on same-sex partnerships and marriages in Sweden are available through the country’s extensive population-register system. This makes it possible to carry out a demographic survey of the patterns in same-sex marriage formation and marriage dissolution for a period that covers more than just the initial phase of very new same-sex marriages. Our study expands on previous demographic research on same-sex marriages in Scandinavia by Andersson et al. (2006), Andersson and Noack (2010), and Wiik et al. (2014), with the goal of determining whether previously observed patterns of same-sex marriage dynamics reflected any long-standing patterns in marriage formation and divorce or rather those dominated by the pioneers of same-sex spouses. We further examine the increasingly important role of childbearing in same-sex union dynamics. Earlier findings indicated a crossover from a dominance of male couples to that of female unions in same-sex marriage formation; they also demonstrated elevated divorce risks in same-sex marriages of women (Andersson et al. 2006; Wiik et al. 2014). In our study, we aim to provide better insight into the situation in Sweden based on data covering a longer period and focusing on changes in patterns over time.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Before estimating multivariable regression models, we performed multiple imputation with chained equations with 80 imputed data sets, using all variables in the substantive model as well as auxiliary variables (see the online appendix) in the imputation process (Carpenter and Kenward 2012).

Consumer reference data companies accumulate records from various commercial transactions (e.g., subscription services) and create individual-level national databases documenting the characteristics of an individual. I use an extract of data from one such company, Infutor Data Solutions. The data attach individual identities to address histories for essentially the full adult population of the United States, including exact street addresses and dates for which the address is valid. These data were introduced to the academic literature in a recent study of rent control (Diamond et al. 2019). I use the same data to measure the number, timing, and location of housing moves for particularly unstably housed people. Although measures of housing instability may in general include other characteristics (Frederick et al. 2014), I focus on how the data can measure housing instability as defined by frequent moves.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

Some analyses can avoid the most difficult ethical questions by using only a subset of the data. For example, all the analyses in this article use only data that Infutor provides to external customers for non–research purposes: address histories, names, month of birth, and year of birth. Given their availability to customers outside research, these data may be viewed in discussions of ethics as public information, which reduces their ethical sensitivity in institutional review and other ethical discussions. Such discussions become more complicated when additional information, such as SSNs, is used. Of course, careful attention to ethics is important even when attention is limited to address histories. The present study was approved by a local Institutional Review Board, and ethics affected the choice of analysis in several ways. To give a particular example, Fig. 7 is aggregated to ZIP code and does not show individual points. This presentation was chosen to avoid identifying individual HPCC callers. More generally, combining address history with other data that are not publicly available or publishing results with detailed geographic information, such as maps, raises ethical issues.

We include these measures primarily to control for the confounding effects of state-to-state economic and cultural differences that could be associated with higher childcare costs. Data on advanced degrees, median earnings, and occupations come from the 2015 American Community Survey five-year file. State minimum wage data for 2015 are obtained from the Department of Labor's historical archive. Data on cultural gender norms are less readily available at the state level because few surveys measure attitudes and beliefs with large enough samples for state analysis. Therefore, we use organic data measuring public sentiment toward feminism expressed on Twitter. We use an established data set that has been validated in previous research (Scarborough 2018), using naïve Bayes classification to code 105,066 tweets about feminism as positive or negative and linking them to states based on Twitter users' bios to calculate the percentage of positive tweets toward feminism in each state.5 Research indicates that support for feminism correlates with cultural norms of gender egalitarianism more broadly (Banaszak and Ondercin 2016; Scarborough 2018). Given research showing that this measure correlates highly with average state support for equal divisions of household labor (r = .5; Scarborough 2018), we use this item to capture states' cultural environment. Because our state-level economic and cultural variables are on different metrics, we standardize them using z scores prior to combining them into an index (alpha = .85). Places with better economic conditions (e.g., higher wages and better job opportunities) tended to have more positive support toward feminism. We include this index in our models to test whether states' economic and cultural contexts outweigh the higher childcare costs in these areas.6",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA

In this research, we use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index4 (NDVI) as a proxy for community-level food availability. Specifically, we use NDVI data from a data series provided by the Integrated Climate Data Center at Universität Hamburg (Pinzon and Tucker 2014). These data are a quality-controlled version of the NDVI data provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (NASA-GIMMS; Tucker et al. 2005). NDVI serves as a measure of greenness and is available at a relatively fine spatial (1/12-degree grid cell, or roughly 8 kilometers) and temporal (bimonthly) resolution. Thus, NDVI allows for a proxy measure of vegetation that varies throughout the year and at a scale that is fine enough to reflect village- or community-level variation over space and time. Although food security is more complex than food availability alone, NDVI in semiarid zones such as in Mali captures the interannual variability of yield across all crops. NDVI is particularly relevant in Mali because the vast majority of Malian farmers rely on rainfall as their primary source of moisture, particularly in communities far from surface water (Husak and Grace 2016; FEWS NET livelihood reports for Mali, https://fews.net/west-africa/mali).",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA

NDVI is a measure of greenness, which has been shown to be related to primary productivity and leaf area of plants (Sellers 1985; Townshend and Justice 1986), and provides a way to directly measure the impact of moisture and temperature conditions on vegetation health. In application, NDVI has been linked to local agricultural production and can be used to proxy variations in locally produced food (Grace et al. 2016; Husak et al. 2008). Here we use NDVI data from the Integrated Climate Data Center at Universität Hamburg; this data set is a quality-controlled version of the NASA-GIMMS NDVI products (Tucker et al. 2005). The NDVI data are available at bimonthly (∼15-day) time steps and 1/12-degree spatial resolution from 1981 to 2015.7 In this research, we consider seasonal maximum NDVI to be a proxy for crop production and ultimately food security and availability (i.e., the food insecurity pathway).",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA

However, data collection on gender minorities continues to be sparse, especially in survey research (Schilt and Lagos 2017). In 2018, the GSS began to ask respondents about their gender identity and sex assigned at birth at the end of its self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) (Smith and Son 2019).

The two-step gender identity measure has shown to be a valid and cognitively feasible measure of the difference between sex assigned at birth and gender identity for both cisgender and transgender respondents (Lombardi and Banik 2016; Reisner et al. 2014; Reisner et al. 2015). Pointing to previously published studies and other data sets, we provided evidence to the members of the GSS Board of Overseers that the two-step measure was valid and could be reliable.

For example, the NHS provides funding for up to three cycles of IVF in Scotland, up to two cycles in Wales, and up to one cycle in Northern Ireland. In contrast, in England, funding depends on the area where a couple lives. Thus, in England, the provision of fertility treatments is subject to the so-called postcode lottery. For example, whereas three IVF cycles are funded in Camden (London), the Clinical Commissioning Group does not offer any IVF cycle in North East Essex. Moreover, in addition to varying by region and (in England) area of residence, whether funding for IVF is granted depends on the woman’s age (usually whether she is younger than 40); her length of infertility (usually whether she has had at least two years of regular and unprotected intercourse), lifestyle factors, such as her BMI, smoking status, and relationship length; whether she or her partner has children from previous relationships (ESHRE 2017 European Audit Policy on Fertility). The eligibility criteria vary from area to area. The provision of other MAR treatments, such as intrauterine insemination, also varies by area. The UKHLS does not provide information as to whether a given MAR treatment took place in the private or public sector. We estimate, however, that most MAR treatments in our data took place in the private sector because in the United Kingdom, a larger proportion of such treatments are provided in the private sector. In 2013, 41.3% of IVF cycles were funded by the NHS, whereas 58.7% were funded privately (ESHRE 2017 European Audit Policy on Fertility). Because the proportion of NHS-funded MAR treatments remained stable in the United Kingdom from 2012 to 2017, we do not expect to observe systematic changes in the composition of MAR couples in our data.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,NA

The measure of votes cast for a Republican president was the proportion of voters who voted for the Republican candidate within a given county at Wave I; this value was standardized (Fowler et al. 2010). The proportion of Republican voters in an individual's neighborhood has been shown to impact the mental health of sexual minority adults (Everett 2014). Other research has demonstrated that conservative ideology is associated with prejudice against LGB persons, in part because of the linkage between conservative ideology and the endorsement of traditional gender roles (Prusaczyk and Hodson 2018) and because hostile sexist attitudes predict voting for Republican presidential candidates (Bock et al. 2017; Schaffner et al. 2018). Conservative denomination adherents per capita was measured at the county level at Wave I.

(2), which informs about systematic deviations from the general pattern of mortality, for estimating the set of coefficients vx. For this purpose, we estimated the covariance matrix of the residuals Ψ⁠, whose element (z,y) is given by Ψzy=1N−3⋅∑i=1Nei(z)⋅ei(y)⁠. Following a common approach in demographic estimation (Clark 2019; Lee and Carter 1992; Wilmoth et al. 2012; Wilmoth 1990), we estimated the set of coefficients vx as the first-orthonormal eigenvector (of V⁠) resulting from an SVD applied to the covariance matrix: Ψ=V⋅∑ ⋅ U⁠. The SVD provides a least-squares solution to the principal components of the residuals, hence the first vector will account for the higher proportion of the overall covariance. In our case, the first eigenvalue accounts for 88% of the total sum of eigenvalues.

For certain applications, it may be desirable to fit the model with input death probabilities that do not start at age 0 and/or do not end at age 5 years. One example of such a configuration is when the only available input values are observed values of q(28d) and q(12m). In some other applications, it may be useful to estimate the model parameters after excluding information at neonatal ages, for example, owing to concerns about the quality of the data at these ages. In that case, q(28d,5y), rather than q(5y), would be a preferable input value. Another situation is when the available input values are mortality rates (nMx), rather than probabilities, over age-groups that do not conform with the model's harmonized age-groups. For all these more complex applications, estimating the model parameters cannot be performed using the method described earlier because of nonlinearities in the system of equations. These applications can be resolved using simple iterative procedures, or using a more general approach based on the method of Lagrange. This more general approach is described in the online Appendix 2. We also use the Lagrange approach in an R package, called “logquad5q0,” which we provide as a companion to this article. This package, available at https://github.com/verhulsta/logquad5q0, allows users to use the log-quadratic model to predict a full set of 22 nMx and q(x) values by detailed age, by sex or for both sexes combined, based on a variety of inputs.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA
